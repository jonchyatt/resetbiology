      content: `TB-500 is a synthetic version of Thymosin Beta-4, a naturally occurring peptide present in virtually all human and animal cells. This 43-amino acid peptide has been extensively studied for its wound healing and tissue repair properties.

**Research Applications:**
- Wound healing acceleration
- Muscle injury recovery
- Cardiovascular protection
- Anti-inflammatory effects
- Hair follicle development

**Mechanism of Action:**
TB-500 works primarily through the upregulation of actin, a protein that forms part of the cell's structural framework. This upregulation promotes cell migration, which is essential for wound healing, tissue building, and blood vessel development.

**Safety Profile:**
TB-500 has demonstrated a favorable safety profile in research studies, with minimal reported adverse effects when used appropriately in research settings.`,

- Standard protocol: 2-5mg per injection
- Frequency: 2-3 times per week
- Duration: 4-6 week cycles
- Administration: Subcutaneous or intramuscular

**Reconstitution Guidelines:**
1. Use bacteriostatic water for injection
2. Add 1-2mL slowly to the vial
3. Gently swirl to dissolve (do not shake)
4. Store reconstituted solution at 2-8Â°C
5. Use within 14 days of reconstitution

**Important Considerations:**
- Always use sterile technique
- Rotate injection sites
- Monitor for any adverse reactions
- Maintain proper storage conditions`,
