While there are promising studies, it is still undetermined as to whether or not BPC-157 can be fully absorbed through the intestinal wall when taken orally for recovery throughout the body. However, it has been shown to provide tremendous benefits to the gut, GI tract, and gut-brain axis when taken orally.\n\nAs a result, users can experience a reduction of inflammation, improved gut health, improved mood, and reduction of stomach/gut pain. In addition, individuals may also feel some relief to aches and pains from chronic injuries, but this result cannot be guaranteed.\n\nPlease see our Joint & Wound Healing Protocol Package for injectable BPC-157.\n\n\n\n\n“Patient with Crohn’s disease has had significant decrease in stomach p"
