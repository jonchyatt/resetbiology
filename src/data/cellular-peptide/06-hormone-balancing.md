## How does the protocol work?

The Hormone Balancing Protocol Package utilizes the peptide **Kisspeptin**.

### Mechanism of Action
When the peptide Kisspeptin is injected, it stimulates GnRH (Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone) and regulates the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, influencing the reproductive health and hormones in both men and women.

Kisspeptin can also increase LH and FSH levels, testosterone levels, and sex drive. Additionally, it is involved in budding research in reproductive studies, benefitting individuals with fertility issues.

### Results
As a result, users can experience improved reproductive hormones and sex drive, improved mood, regulated menstrual cycles, improved weight management, and improved overall health.
