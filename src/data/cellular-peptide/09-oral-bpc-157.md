## What does the protocol help with?

- Serotonin Production
- Expedites Healing of Gastrointestinal Issues
- Inflammation-Induced Conditions
- Stomach & Gut Related Conditions

## How does the protocol work?

Oral BPC-157 is unlike other oral peptides as it employs a patented, natural delivery approach that enables oral BPC-157 administration by conjugating lactoferrin to the BPC-157 peptide, allowing secure absorption to the epithelial cell surface within the oral cavity and lower intestines. In addition, a liposome is utilized to safeguard the chelated BPC-157 from being broken down in the stomach.

### Mechanism of Action
The BPC-157 peptide speeds up the body's anti-inflammatory and recovery properties throughout the body. While there are promising studies, it is still undetermined as to whether or not BPC-157 can be fully absorbed through the intestinal wall when taken orally for recovery throughout the body. However, it has been shown to provide tremendous benefits to the gut, GI tract, and gut-brain axis when taken orally.

### Results
As a result, users can experience a reduction of inflammation, improved gut health, improved mood, and reduction of stomach/gut pain. In addition, individuals may also feel some relief to aches and pains from chronic injuries, but this result cannot be guaranteed.

### Note
Please see our Joint & Wound Healing Protocol Package for injectable BPC-157.
