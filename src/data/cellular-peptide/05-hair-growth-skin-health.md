## How does the protocol work?

The Hair Growth & Skin Health Protocol Package utilizes the peptide **GHK-Cu** (Copper peptide), which is a natural peptide found in blood plasma, urine, and saliva.

### Mechanism of Action
Research has found that GHK-Cu provides substantial benefits for skin health by stimulating collagen production and fibroblasts. It is also known to promote hair growth by accelerating the hair follicle growth cycle.

### Skin Benefits
GHK-Cu is quickly gaining popularity in the skin-care and cosmetic world as it improves elasticity of the skin while tightening and firming. It has also been shown to reduce damage due to sunlight, reduce hyperpigmentation, and reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.

### Additional Benefits
Other benefits include improved wound and tissue healing, immune function, and protection from free-radical damage.

### Results
As a result, users can experience improved skin health, look, and feel, thicker and longer hair, and anti-aging.
