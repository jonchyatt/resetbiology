## How does the protocol work?

The Tanning & Sexual Benefits Protocol Package utilizes the peptide **MT-2** (melanotan-2).

### Mechanism of Action
The MT-2 peptide has a wide range of benefits including appetite suppression, skin pigmentation, help combatting certain skin cancers, and to aid with erectile dysfunction and testosterone production. However, the two most prominent effects that have been conclusively proven in studies are producing erections and arousal and the tanning of skin.

MT-2 is derived from alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (a-MSH) which is responsible for the production of melanin in the skin. It works by stimulating the production of melanin, thereby resulting in a tan without the need for exposure to UV rays.

### Neuroprotective Effects
MT-2 has also been shown to have neuroprotective effects. Studies have shown reduced neuronal damage and improved cognitive function when used as a treatment for traumatic brain injury.

### Results
As a result, users will experience the tanning of skin (including freckles and moles), reduced appetite, increased erections and sexual arousal, and improved brain function.

## Patient Testimonials

### C. Stockwell
"The tanning protocol was eerily fun. After just a week, I noticed freckles and then a soft golden tan beginning to manifest. I accelerated the process by mowing and running without a shirt. It was so even that a woman from the Caribbean asked I was 'mixed race'."
