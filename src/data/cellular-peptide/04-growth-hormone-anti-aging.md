## How does the protocol work?

The Growth Hormone & Anti-Aging Protocol Package utilizes the peptides **CJC-1295** and **Ipamorelin**, combined into a single vial.

### CJC-1295
CJC-1295 has been shown to increase human growth hormone (HGH) levels in the body, resulting in increased muscle mass, reduced fat, and improved energy levels. It also has anti-aging effects as it can increase collagen production, reduce wrinkles, and improve skin elasticity.

### Ipamorelin
Ipamorelin has also been shown to increase muscle mass (including in individuals with muscle-wasting conditions), improve cognitive function, and reduce inflammation.

### Combined Effects
This effective combination of CJC-1295 and Ipamorelin effectively promotes the increase of growth hormone by increasing the pulse of growth hormone release within the body and the number of cells that secrete growth hormone (somatotrophs).

### Results
As a result, users can expect to lose body fat, gain muscle, reduce inflammation, and have increased energy levels.

### Side Effects
Please note that the CJC-1295/Ipamorelin combination may cause a rush of increased blood flow upon injecting resulting in red, hot, tingly skin and increased heart rate. These effects normally wear off within 20-30 minutes of injection.
