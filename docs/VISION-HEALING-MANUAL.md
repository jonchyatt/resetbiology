## Key Components

### 1. Snellen Trainer

**What it does:** Adaptive visual acuity trainer based on standard Snellen charts.

**How to use:**

#### Mode Selection:
- **Near Mode:** Tests convergence and near-point focus (10-80cm)
- **Far Mode:** Tests distance clarity (30-200cm)

Click the **"Near"** or **"Far"** button to switch modes.

#### Distance Guidance:
1. The slider shows your current viewing distance
2. Adjust distance based on real-time instructions:
   - **Near Mode:**
     - "Dial closer in 0.5cm increments..."
     - "Great near control. Try a micro-hold at 10cm..."
   - **Far Mode:**
     - "If letters are clear, step back 2cm..."
     - "Hold steady — log this distance as baseline"
3. Read the displayed letters to test clarity
4. Note the distance where blur begins

#### Chart Types:
- **Letters:** Standard Snellen letters (E, F, D, P, L, T, C, O)
- **Directional:** E's pointing up, down, left, right

Click **"Shuffle Line"** to randomize and prevent memorization.

#### What to Track:
- **Near Point of Convergence:** Closest distance before blur (goal: <5cm)
- **Far Snellen Distance:** Furthest line you can read clearly (goal: 3m at 20/20)

## Tracking Metrics

Log these metrics weekly to track progress:

   - Use Focus Pushups; record closest distance before blur

2. **Far Snellen Distance** (target: 3m clear 20/20 line)
   - Use Snellen trainer; log furthest clean line

3. **Smooth Pursuit Stability** (target: 45°/sec without head drift)
   - Film Smooth Tracking; count frames where head leaves midline

4. **Peripheral Awareness Score** (target: ≥10 objects per sweep)
   - Peripheral Pointing drill; number of distinct objects identified per minute

---

## Readiness Prompts

Before each session, answer these to assess readiness:

1. How gritty or hydrated do your eyes feel before today's work?
2. Any neck/upper-trap tightness that might limit ocular range?
3. What was the furthest clear Snellen line yesterday (near + far)?
4. Rate today's screen load (low / medium / brutal)

## Best Practices

1. **Start with Wave 1** - Don't skip the primer phase
2. **Follow the rhythm** - Rest days are critical for neural adaptation
3. **Log your metrics** - Track progress in journal or spreadsheet
4. **Use recovery cues** - Palming between sets, eye massages hourly
5. **Reduce screen time** - Limit blue light exposure during protocol weeks
6. **Natural light walks** - 10-15 minutes daily outdoors, no phone
