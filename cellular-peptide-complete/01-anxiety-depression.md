## How does the protocol work?

The Anxiety & Depression Protocol Package utilizes a combination of the peptides **Semax** and **Selank**.

### Semax
When the peptide Semax is injected, it is delivered to the pituitary gland to increase the production of the happy hormones, serotonin and dopamine. It also increases BDNF (Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor) to aid in learning and memory and GABA (Gamma-aminobutyric Acid) to calm the brain.

### Selank
When the peptide Selank is injected, the GABA receptors are stimulated, promoting relaxation and calmness while reducing tension and restlessness. Selank has been shown to enhance cognitive function, reduce anxiety and stress, improve mood and sleep, and boost the immune response. Additionally, it helps regulate cortisol levels in the body, which are responsible for inducing stress responses.

### Results
As a result, users can experience improved mental clarity and focus, improved mood and sleep, less stress and anxiety, while feeling more relaxed overall.

### J. Crane
"I have struggled with frequent periods of depression since my teen years. In the past I have treated my depression with different options including pharmaceuticals, which I eventually stopped because I was unable to tolerate the side effects associated with the drugs. My life has significantly improved since taking the Anxiety/Depression peptide protocol having no further episodes of depression and I experience more stable moods"
