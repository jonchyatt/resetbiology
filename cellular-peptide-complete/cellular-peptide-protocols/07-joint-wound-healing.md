## How does the protocol work?

The Joint & Wound Healing Protocol Package utilizes the peptides **BPC-157** and **TB-500**, combined into a single vial. This combination of peptides is often referred to as the "Wolverine" protocol within the industry for its powerful healing potential.

### Mechanism of Action
BPC-157 and TB-500 provide a wide range of benefits including reduction of inflammation (and inflammation induced pain) and repair of damaged tissue, including both internal injuries and external wounds. Studies have also found that little to no scar tissue is produced during injury and wound repair with this peptide combination.

### Results
As a result, users can experience a reduction of pain and inflammation, increased healing times for injuries and wounds, and an increase in athletic performance.

### Protocol Recommendation
Please note that for the best results, we recommend performing 2 back-to-back 6 week cycles of this protocol, for a total of 12 weeks.

## Patient Testimonials

### T. Lankering, Health Professional from Colorado
"I had pretty severe arthritis in both hands, tendonitis in my thumb, a shoulder sprain from a bike fall this summer, and I was thinking that I was going to schedule another hip replacement this fall. Within 4 days of being on the protocol I noticed a 50% improvement in all of my aches and pains. In 6 weeks I experienced a 90-95% improvement in all my aches and pains. My hip pain is not even on the radar. I am not considering a hip replacement and I am looking forward to a full winter of skiing. I was riding my bike this fall and had a moment when I thought to myself, "Wow! I don't feel any pain!" It had been a long time since I said that. I am amazed!"

### B. Schooner
"Doctor told me I would probably need knee surgery. Then a friend told me about the wolverine protocol with BPC-157 and TB-500. I gave it a try and after 7 weeks, my knee pain was completely gone. It truly is amazing. Saved me 10s of thousands of dollars and a lot of pain."

### Doug Grant
"I had a shoulder injury for over 2 years and followed nutrient, nutrition and rehab perfectly to no avail... I started the BPC-157 / TB-500 protocol and by the 2nd month I was pain free and lifting like I did years previously."
