- Chronic Fatigue Syndrome & Other Energy Deficient States
- DNA Damage & Genomic Stability
- Mitochondrial Dysfunction

## How does the protocol work?

The Natural Energy Reset Protocol Package utilizes the peptides **DSIP** (Delta Sleep-Inducing Peptide) and **NAD+**.

### DSIP (Delta Sleep-Inducing Peptide)
DSIP is primarily associated with sleep regulation and its ability to modulate sleep patterns. It has been linked to promoting delta-wave sleep, which is the deep, restorative stage of non-REM sleep. DSIP influences the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, helping to maintain hormonal balance (such as cortisol) and reduce stress-related disruptions. DSIP has also been shown to support neuronal health and cellular repair, as well as modulate metabolic activity within the central nervous system. It has been shown to improve sleep quality, reduce stress-related symptoms, and support overall recovery processes.

### NAD+
NAD+ plays a crucial role in cellular energy production, metabolic processes, and signaling pathways. It is central to the production of ATP, the body's main energy currency, and is vital for sustaining the energy demand of cells. NAD+ is also involved in DNA repair, helping to maintain genomic integrity and cellular longevity.

NAD+ levels decline as we age. Restoring our NAD+ levels can help maintain sirtuin activity, which helps to regulate various cellular processes including gene expression, mitochondrial function, and stress resistance, resulting in healthier aging.

Leveraging NAD+ levels will:
- Support energy production by enhancing mitochondrial function, helping the cells to produce more energy
- Improve metabolic health by supporting the pathways that regulate glucose and lipid metabolism
- Promote neuroprotection by reducing oxidative stress and supporting brain function

### Results
As a result, users will experience more restorative, consistent sleep, naturally increased energy levels, and healthier aging.

New research is being performed and continuously discovering new exciting benefits of these peptides.
