## How does the protocol work?

The Sexual Enhancement Package utilizes the peptide **PT-141**. This protocol is also widely known as the "Date Night Protocol" within the industry.

### Mechanism of Action
PT-141, also known as bremelanotide, improves sexual function in both men and women by stimulating the melanocortin receptors in the brain. This induces a heightened sense of arousal and sexual desire. PT-141 also increases blood flow to the penis or vagina and clitoris, improving intimate experiences.

### Results
As a result, users will experience increased libido and sexual desire, improved sexual function, improved female sexual arousal disorder (FSAD), and increased lubrication, orgasms, and satisfaction.

### Side Effects
Please note that upon injection, blood flow will dramatically increase and may cause nausea, headaches, and red, hot, tingly skin. These side effects are typically mild and short-lived.

## Patient Testimonials

### D. Grant, HP from Arizona
"Client said, 'My wife didn't have the same level of desire as I did and I thought it was me. After she took PT-141, we realized it was just chemical. We're on the same page (and sheets) now.'"
