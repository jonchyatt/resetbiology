 Project Goal:\*\* Develop a mobile application designed to improve eyesight by strengthening eye muscles through conscious focusing exercises at various distances. The app aims to provide a systematized, quantifiable, and guided training experience, similar to progressive weight training. This app is for personal use and not intended as medical advice. \*\*2. Core Functionality:\*\* The app will display high-definition visual targets (Snellen charts) that users will consciously focus on to sharpen their vision. The app will dynamically adjust difficulty based on user performance and provide real-time guidance on both visual accuracy and physical distance from the screen. \*\*3. Key Features & Functionality:\*\* \* \*\*Exercise Types:\*\* \* \*\*Snellen Chart (Letters):\*\* Displays standard Snellen chart letters. Users will verbally identify the letters. \* \*\*Snellen Chart (E Directional):\*\* Displays the "E" chart. Users will verbally identify the direction the "E" is facing. \* \*\*Visual Design:\*\* \* \*\*High Definition Vector Graphics:\*\* All visual targets (letters, "E"s) will be rendered using vector images to ensure incredible sharpness, accuracy, and clean corners/angles regardless of size. \* \*\*Color Scheme:\*\* Black targets on a white background for maximum contrast and clarity, which is crucial for focusing exercises. \* \*\*Font:\*\* Traditional Snellen chart fonts (e.g., Helvetica) will be used for letters. A custom graphic will be used for the "E" directional, ensuring the three equal-length arms adhere to standard conventions. \* \*\*Full Screen Display:\*\* The Snellen chart or "E" will occupy the full screen during exercises to minimize distractions. \* \*\*Dynamic Adjustment & Guided Training:\*\* \* \*\*Real-time Distance Tracking:\*\* Utilize the phone's camera, gyroscope, and/or accelerometer to accurately estimate and track the distance the phone is held from the user's eye. \* \*\*Two-Fold Feedback System:\*\* 1\. \*\*Accuracy Feedback:\*\* The app will provide immediate verbal feedback on whether the user correctly identified the letters or "E" directions (e.g., "Good job, you got those right\!" or "Oops, not quite."). 2\. \*\*Distance Guidance:\*\* The app will provide real-time verbal guidance to help the user position the phone at the precise target distance for the current level (e.g., "A little closer...", "Perfect\! You're at the right distance."). \* \*\*Adaptive Difficulty:\*\* \* \*\*Direction of Movement:\*\* \* If improving \*\*Far Vision:\*\* A positive outcome (correct identification) will prompt the user to move the phone further away. A negative outcome (incorrect identification) will prompt the user to move the phone closer. \* If improving \*\*Near Vision:\*\* A positive outcome (correct identification) will prompt the user to move the phone closer. A negative outcome (incorrect identification) will prompt the user to move the phone further away. \* \*\*Increment Size:\*\* Distance adjustments will occur in small increments (e.g., half-centimeter by default, with a user-customizable option) to allow for gradual eye muscle adaptation. \* \*\*Level Progression:\*\* Users will be guided to the precise target distance for the current level. Once they confirm they are at the correct distance, they will attempt the test. Success moves them to a harder level (further/closer depending on vision type); failure moves them to an easier level (closer/further). \* \*\*Vision Type Selection:\*\* \* Users will select whether they are working on "Near Vision" or "Far Vision" improvement from the main menu. This selection will dictate the direction of distance adjustment during exercises. \* \*\*Progress Tracking & Session Management:\*\* \* \*\*Session Tracking:\*\* The app will track and record user progress session-to-session, including timing of sessions and performance metrics (e.g., distance achieved, accuracy percentage). \* \*\*Resumable Sessions:\*\* Users will be able to resume their training from their last achieved level, preventing the need to start over. \* \*\*Visualized Progress:\*\* Implement graphs or charts to visually represent eyesight progress over time (e.g., showing changes in achievable distance). \* \*\*User Interface (UI):\*\* \* \*\*Clean and Intuitive:\*\* Simple, uncluttered interface. \* \*\*Main Menu:\*\* Clear options for selecting: \* "Near Vision" exercises \* "Far Vision" exercises \* "Letters" (for Snellen chart) \* "E Directional" (for E chart) \* \*\*Exercise Screen Display:\*\* \* The Snellen chart/E will be the primary focus. \* A small, clear display of the current \*\*target distance in centimeters\*\* will be visible. \* A progress bar or indicator to show advancement within the current session/level.
