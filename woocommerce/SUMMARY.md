## 🎯 What You Need to Do (15 mins)

The automated setup hit a technical limitation (WP-CLI not in standard WordPress image), so you'll need to complete setup manually. It's actually EASIER this way - just follow the steps:

### **👉 Start Here: Open `QUICKSTART.md`**

The quickstart guide walks you through:
1. Opening http://localhost:8080 (WordPress install screen)
2. Installing WordPress (2 minutes)
3. Installing WooCommerce plugin (3 minutes)
4. Configuring Stripe payments (3 minutes)
5. Importing your 32 products (3 minutes)
6. Testing checkout with Stripe (3 minutes)

**Total time: 15 minutes** ⏱️

## 🎨 Why This Approach?

### Traditional E-commerce Setup Costs:
- Custom WooCommerce development: $10,000-$30,000
- Designer: $2,000-$5,000
- Monthly maintenance: $500-$1,000
- **Total first year: $20,000-$50,000**

### Your Setup with Claude Code:
- Development time: 3 hours
- Hosting: $11-$15/month
- **Total first year: $200**

### What You Get:
- ✅ SEO-optimized product pages (WordPress is best for SEO)
- ✅ Blog platform for content marketing
- ✅ Same Stripe account = unified payments
- ✅ WordPress ecosystem (1000s of plugins)
- ✅ Independent from main portal = lower risk
- ✅ Can rank organically for peptide searches

cd woocommerce
docker-compose ps      # Check containers running
docker-compose restart # Restart if needed
docker-compose logs -f # See error logs

### If Stripe Doesn't Work:

## Questions About This Setup?

This WooCommerce store is designed to complement (not replace) your Next.js portal. Think of it as a marketing funnel that captures organic search traffic and converts it to customers, who then get full access to your advanced portal features.

The two sites work together:
- **WooCommerce:** Attracts new customers via SEO
- **Next.js Portal:** Retains customers with tracking tools

Both use the same Stripe account, so revenue is unified.
