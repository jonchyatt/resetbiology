## 🎓 LESSONS LEARNED

1. **Component Reuse:** Many components already existed and just needed API integration
2. **Consistent Patterns:** Following peptide system architecture made development fast
3. **Database Schema:** Prisma models were already well-designed
4. **Gamification:** Point system seamlessly integrated across all features
5. **Auth0 Pattern:** Reusable session verification simplified endpoint security
