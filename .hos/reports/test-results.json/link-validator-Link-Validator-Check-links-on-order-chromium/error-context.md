          - paragraph [ref=e174]: Retatrutide is the most potent compound for weight reduction, operating as a triple agonist (GLP-1, GIP, and Glucagon) that demonstrated superior fat loss in trials, achieving up to a 24.2% reduction in body weight over 48 weeks, significantly surpassing Semaglutide and Tirzepatide. Its unique activation of the glucagon receptor promotes efficient fat oxidation and metabolic remodeling, establishing it as a systemic "biological operating system upgrade" that helps restore hormone balance and reverses biological markers of aging and metabolic dysfunction.
